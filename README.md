# .bricks

Super cool mason bricks. Like .dotfiles but for mason bricks.

## What building blocks can you find here?

Most of these bricks were created for my personal use, but certainly they can suite your needs (or at least you can learn a thing or two). Below is a quick summary of them.

|Name|Description|Example|
|----|-----------|-------|
|browser_automation|Template to build CLI applications that perform browser automation using [puppeteer](https://github.com/xvrh/puppeteer-dart)|[randomize-photo-mosh](https://github.com/cobrinhas/randomize-photo-mosh)|
|cloud_run|Template to build ready-for-deploy applications in GCP Cloud Run|[node-cloud-run](https://github.com/freitzzz/node-cloud-run)|
|repository|Generates source-code for abstractions of the data layer|[dart-firebase-authentication-repository](https://github.com/freitzzz/dart-firebase-authentication-repository)|
|tijolo|Template to generate bricks for dart-pacotes/.bricks|[tijolo](https://github.com/dart-pacotes/.bricks/tree/master/tijolo)|

They are also published in [brickhub.dev](https://brickhub.dev/).
